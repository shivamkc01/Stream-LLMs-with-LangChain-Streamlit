# ChatGPT Clone with Streaming Feature using Streamlit

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Streaming demo from LangChain and Streamlit. This repository contains the code for a Streamlit-based chatbot application. The app is designed to remember previous messages and provide real-time, streamed responses to user inputs.

## Features
- **Interactive Chatbot**: Engage in conversations where the chatbot retains context from previous messages.
- **Streaming Responses**: Responses are streamed in real-time, providing a dynamic and interactive user experience.
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images and interact with the chatbot, asking questions about the uploaded images.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify the chatbot's behavior by adjusting the prompt templates and integrating with different language models.

## Prerequisites
To run the app, ensure you have Python and Conda installed on your machine.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1. **Create a Conda Environment**:
    ```sh
    # Create a new Conda environment (replace 'env_name' with your preferred environment name)
    conda create --name env_name python=3.9
    ```

2. **Activate the Conda Environment**:
    ```sh
    conda activate env_name
    ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
    - Add your OpenAI API key in the `.env` file:
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```

## Usage
To start the Streamlit app, run the following command in your terminal:
```sh
streamlit run src/app.py
```
This command will launch the Streamlit application, and you can interact with the chatbot in your web browser.
